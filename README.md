# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to create data relationship diagrams, perform data modeling, and an analysis on an employee database for Pewlett Hackard. The analysis used SQL techniques to preform queries to help determine the number of employees who are going to retire soon. The information obtained in the queries includes their employee info like name, start date, age, titles, and departments. Tables were created intially to import the data sources of salaries, departments, employees, managment, and titles. An additional analysis was requested to find the number of employees retiring sorted by title and the number of employees eligible for the mentorship program.

## Summary

How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
- 


Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
- 

One thing this data suggests is to promote from within the company and allow lower level employees wot fill the rolls of seniors about to reitre and hire for entry level positions instead. It is advisable to do this since promoting from within ensures that those in high profile senior level positions can be trusted and are familiar with the company.
